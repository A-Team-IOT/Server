# node-iot-sockets
A NodeJS server that acts as a central server for controlling devices connected with socket.io

The Arduino test code: https://github.com/ryan-peirce/ArduinoSocketTest

This project will allow users to login, and access their "command portal" where thay can dynamically add devices and get UI controls
with little or no UI configuration. This will be done by defining user actions on the devices and registering this with the server on 
connection. The devives will need to connect via socket.io and have the server ip or url known as welll as login credentials.
